## Elevator Pitch (250 chars)
TeamDock transforms hackathon team building from awkward introductions to seamless connections. Find teammates by skills, join teams instantly, and collaborate in real-time. Because great ideas deserve great teams.

## Inspiration Section
At ShellHack, we noticed a recurring problem: talented individuals sitting alone, struggling to find teammates, missing out on the collaborative magic of hackathons. The room was full of potential, but lacking connections. TeamDock was born from this observation - to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity.

## What It Does Section
TeamDock is a real-time team formation and collaboration platform designed specifically for hackathons:

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Team Discovery**: Browse teams based on their tech stack, project ideas, and required skills
- **Skill-Based Matching**: Create profiles highlighting your expertise (Frontend, Backend, ML/AI, Design, etc.)
- **Real-Time Team Feed**: Share updates, celebrate milestones, and keep everyone in sync
- **Team Management Dashboard**: Leaders can manage join requests, set team status, and coordinate members
- **Live Activity Feed**: See what's happening across all teams in real-time
- **Secure Authentication**: Simple, secure login with secret codes - no complex passwords needed
- **Team Statistics**: Track team progress, member contributions, and hackathon metrics
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops

## How We Built It Section
**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript for type-safe, performant React applications
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI development
- **Backend**: Supabase for real-time database, authentication, and serverless functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with custom RPC functions for complex operations
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, engaging user interactions
- **State Management**: React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions for instant team updates

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Serverless architecture for infinite scalability
- Real-time websocket connections for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Secure RPC functions with row-level security

## Challenges We Ran Into Section
1. **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensuring all team members see updates instantly without overwhelming the server
   - Solution: Implemented smart debouncing and selective subscriptions

2. **Authentication Flow**: Creating a secure yet simple auth system that works for quick hackathon use
   - Solution: Developed a unique secret code system with SHA256 hashing

3. **Database Schema Complexity**: Managing relationships between teams, members, posts, and activities
   - Solution: Carefully designed normalized schema with efficient RPC functions

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Making complex dashboards work seamlessly on small screens
   - Solution: Progressive disclosure and mobile-specific navigation patterns

5. **Team State Management**: Handling various team states (recruiting, full, voting, disbanded)
   - Solution: State machine approach with clear transitions

## Accomplishments Section
- **Built a fully functional platform in 24 hours** at ShellHack
- **Real-time collaboration** working flawlessly with multiple concurrent users
- **Zero downtime** during the entire hackathon
- **Intuitive UX** - users could join teams within seconds of signing up
- **Comprehensive feature set** including team feed, voting, statistics, and more
- **Mobile-first design** that works perfectly on all devices
- **Secure implementation** with proper authentication and authorization

## What We Learned Section
- **The power of real-time**: Live updates transform user engagement
- **Simplicity wins**: Our secret code auth was more popular than complex passwords
- **Mobile matters**: Most hackathon participants use phones to stay connected
- **Community building**: Features that encourage interaction (team feed, reactions) drive adoption
- **Database design is crucial**: Good schema design saved us hours of debugging
- **User feedback is gold**: Iterating based on real user input during the hackathon

## What's Next Section
**Immediate Improvements:**
- Discord integration for seamless team communication
- GitHub integration for automatic repository creation
- AI-powered team recommendations based on skills and interests
- Virtual team rooms with video chat capabilities

**Long-term Vision:**
- Expand beyond hackathons to tech meetups and conferences
