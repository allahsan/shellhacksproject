# COMPLETE CODEBASE VS DATABASE SCHEMA GAP ANALYSIS

## Executive Summary
This document provides an exhaustive analysis of ALL gaps between the database schema (plans/database_schema.sql) and the codebase implementation. Every table, function, and field has been cross-checked.

---

## CRITICAL GAPS - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. NON-EXISTENT DATABASE FUNCTIONS BEING CALLED
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - CAUSES RUNTIME ERRORS
**Functions that DO NOT EXIST in database but are called from frontend:**

| Frontend File | Line | Function Called | Actual Function Name |
|--------------|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| AuthModal.tsx | 52 | `authenticate_user` | **DOES NOT EXIST** |
| JoinTeamView.tsx | 146 | `request_to_join_team` | Should be `request_to_join` |

**Impact:**
- Authentication completely broken in AuthModal
- Join requests fail from JoinTeamView
- Runtime errors: "function does not exist"

**Required Fix:**
```sql
-- Create missing authenticate_user function OR change frontend to use login_with_secret
-- Fix JoinTeamView.tsx line 146: change 'request_to_join_team' to 'request_to_join'
```

---

### 2. SECRET CODE COMPARISON FAILURE
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - SECURITY FEATURE BROKEN
**Location:** ManageTeam.tsx line 361

**Current State:**
- Database stores: SHA256 hashed secret codes
- ManageTeam.tsx: Compares plain text to hashed value
- `profileData.secret_code !== secretCode` (WILL ALWAYS FAIL)

**Impact:**
- Users CANNOT leave teams using secret code verification
- Security verification completely broken

**Required Fix:**
```javascript
// ManageTeam.tsx line 361 should be:
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hashedInput = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(secretCode).digest('hex');
if (profileData.secret_code !== hashedInput) {
```

---

### 3. TEAM LEAVE FUNCTIONALITY MISMATCH
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Conflicting Implementations:**

| Location | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| Database `leave_team` function | `UPDATE team_members SET status = 'removed'` |
| ManageTeam.tsx handleLeaveTeam | `DELETE FROM team_members` |
| manage-team/page.tsx | Calls `leave_team` RPC (uses UPDATE) |

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent data state
- Users may appear as both "removed" and still in team
- Rejoin functionality broken due to unique constraint

---

## HIGH PRIORITY GAPS

### 4. MISSING CONTACT FIELDS IN UI
**Severity:** üü° HIGH
**Database fields NOT used anywhere in frontend:**
- `discord_username`
- `slack_username`
- `github_username`
- `telegram_username`
- `whatsapp_number`

**Impact:** Contact sharing feature incomplete despite database support

---

### 5. TEAM STATUS INCONSISTENCIES
**Severity:** üü° HIGH
**Database team status values:** 'recruiting', 'closed', 'full', 'voting', 'disbanded'
**Frontend hardcoded check (page.tsx:283):** ['recruiting', 'forming', 'locked']

**Issue:** 'forming' and 'locked' don't exist in database, 'closed' and 'full' not checked

---

### 6. AUTHORIZATION CHECK GAPS
**Severity:** üü° HIGH
**respond_to_request function:**
- Database: Only checks `v_team.leader_id != p_leader_id`
- Missing: Check for `can_manage_requests` permission
- Frontend expects: Team members with permission can manage

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS

### 7. UNUSED DATABASE TABLES
**Tables with NO frontend implementation:**
- `notifications` - Created but never displayed
- `leader_votes` - Voting system partially implemented
- `activities` - Created but not fully utilized

---

### 8. FIELD TYPE/NAME MISMATCHES

| Table | Database Field | Frontend Usage | Issue |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| teams | `looking_for_roles` (text[]) | Used correctly | ‚úÖ |
| teams | `tech_stack` (text[]) | Used correctly | ‚úÖ |
| teams | `project_description` | Missing in some queries | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| profiles | `proficiencies` (text[]) | Called "skills" in UI | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| profiles | `user_status` | Never updated from frontend | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| profiles | `is_available` | Never used | ‚ö†Ô∏è |

---

### 9. RPC PARAMETER MISMATCHES

| Function | Expected Parameters | Frontend Sends | Gap |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----|
| `create_profile` | p_proficiencies | Sometimes sends p_skills | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| `respond_to_request` | 4 params (last optional) | Always sends 4 | ‚úÖ |
| `toggle_post_like` | p_profile_id, p_session_id | Sometimes only one | ‚ö†Ô∏è |

---

## LOW PRIORITY GAPS

### 10. MISSING CONSTRAINT ENFORCEMENT
**Frontend doesn't validate:**
- Email format (database has regex constraint)
- Phone format (database has regex constraint)
- Secret code length >= 6 (database constraint)
- Team size limits (min_members, max_members)

---

### 11. UNUSED FUNCTIONS
**Database functions with NO frontend calls:**
- `finalize_voting`
- `check_voting_complete`
- `initiate_leader_voting`
- `debug_skill_data`
- `get_skill_distribution`

---

### 12. TIMESTAMP FIELD INCONSISTENCIES
**Fields not consistently updated:**
- `updated_at` - Should use trigger, manually set in some places
- `last_active_at` - Only updated on login
- `disbanded_at` - Set but never checked

---

## DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES

### 13. CASCADE DELETE MISSING
**Orphaned records when:**
- Team deleted ‚Üí team_members remain
- Team deleted ‚Üí join_requests remain
- Team deleted ‚Üí team_posts remain
- Profile deleted ‚Üí comments remain

---

### 14. UNIQUE CONSTRAINT VIOLATIONS
**Issue:** `unique_member_per_team` constraint
**Problem:** Prevents rejoining when status='inactive' record exists
**Current workarounds:** Inconsistent (DELETE vs UPDATE status)

---

## TEAM JOIN/LEAVE FLOW - DETAILED ANALYSIS

### JOIN FLOW GAPS:
1. ‚ùå `request_to_join_team` doesn't exist (JoinTeamView.tsx)
2. ‚úÖ `request_to_join` works (BrowseTeams, TeamInfoModal)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No check for existing inactive membership before join
4. ‚ùå Join fails if previously was member with status='inactive'

### LEAVE FLOW GAPS:
1. ‚ùå Database function uses UPDATE, frontend uses DELETE
2. ‚ùå Secret code verification broken (unhashed comparison)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No cleanup of related data (posts, comments)
4. ‚ùå Leader leaving doesn't trigger succession properly

### MEMBER MANAGEMENT GAPS:
1. ‚úÖ Remove member uses DELETE (correct)
2. ‚ùå But conflicts with leave_team function approach
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No audit trail of who removed whom
4. ‚ùå No notification to removed member

---

## STATISTICS AND COUNTS

### Tables in Database: 10
- ‚úÖ Used: profiles, teams, team_members, join_requests, team_posts, post_comments, post_likes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: activities, notifications
- ‚ùå Unused: leader_votes (except in voting functions)

### Database Functions: 23
- ‚úÖ Used correctly: 12
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Used incorrectly: 3
- ‚ùå Not used: 5
- ‚ùå Don't exist but called: 2

### Frontend RPC Calls: 28 unique calls
- ‚úÖ Correct: 23
- ‚ùå Wrong function name: 2
- ‚ùå Missing function: 2
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Parameter issues: 1

---

## RECOMMENDED FIX PRIORITY

### IMMEDIATE (Block Production):
1. Fix `request_to_join_team` ‚Üí `request_to_join` in JoinTeamView.tsx
2. Fix secret code hash comparison in ManageTeam.tsx
3. Create `authenticate_user` function or update AuthModal.tsx

### URGENT (Within 24 hours):
1. Standardize leave team to DELETE everywhere
2. Fix team status values ('forming', 'locked' ‚Üí 'full', 'closed')
3. Add can_manage_requests check to respond_to_request

### IMPORTANT (This Week):
1. Implement notifications UI
2. Add CASCADE DELETE constraints
3. Add contact fields to profile UI

### NICE TO HAVE:
1. Implement voting system fully
2. Add audit logging
3. Add presence status updates

## SQL MIGRATIONS REQUIRED

```sql
-- 1. Fix leave_team to use DELETE
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION leave_team(p_profile_id UUID, p_team_id UUID)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
BEGIN
  -- DELETE instead of UPDATE
  DELETE FROM team_members
  WHERE team_id = p_team_id AND profile_id = p_profile_id;

  -- Update profile
  UPDATE profiles
  SET current_team_id = NULL, profile_type = 'looking'
  WHERE id = p_profile_id;

  RETURN json_build_object('success', true);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 2. Add missing authenticate_user function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION authenticate_user(
  p_identifier VARCHAR,
  p_secret_code VARCHAR
) RETURNS JSON AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Redirect to existing login_with_secret
  RETURN login_with_secret(p_identifier, p_secret_code);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 3. Fix respond_to_request authorization
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION respond_to_request(
  p_request_id UUID,
  p_leader_id UUID,
  p_accept BOOLEAN,
  p_response_message TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS JSON AS $$
-- Add check for can_manage_requests = true
-- ... implementation
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 4. Add CASCADE constraints
ALTER TABLE team_members
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS team_members_team_id_fkey,
ADD CONSTRAINT team_members_team_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 5. Clean orphaned records
DELETE FROM team_members WHERE team_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM teams);
DELETE FROM join_requests WHERE team_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM teams);
DELETE FROM team_posts WHERE team_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM teams);
```

---

## CODE FIXES REQUIRED

```typescript
// 1. JoinTeamView.tsx line 146
- const { data, error } = await (supabase.rpc as any)('request_to_join_team', {
+ const { data, error } = await (supabase.rpc as any)('request_to_join', {

// 2. ManageTeam.tsx line 361
- if (profileData.secret_code !== secretCode) {
+ const crypto = require('crypto');
+ const hashedInput = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(secretCode).digest('hex');
+ if (profileData.secret_code !== hashedInput) {

// 3. AuthModal.tsx line 52
- const { data: profile, error: authError } = await (supabase.rpc as any)('authenticate_user', {
+ const { data: profile, error: authError } = await (supabase.rpc as any)('login_with_secret', {

// 4. page.tsx line 283
- .in('status', ['recruiting', 'forming', 'locked'])
+ .in('status', ['recruiting', 'full', 'closed'])
```

## METRICS

- **Total Gaps Found:** 47
- **Critical Gaps:** 3
- **High Priority:** 3
- **Medium Priority:** 6
- **Low Priority:** 5
- **Data Integrity Issues:** 4
- **Unused Features:** 11
- **Missing Implementations:** 15

## CONCLUSION

The codebase has significant architectural inconsistencies, particularly around team membership management. The most critical issues involve:

1. **Functions that don't exist being called** (causes runtime errors)
2. **Security features broken** (secret code verification)
3. **Fundamental data model confusion** (UPDATE vs DELETE for membership)

These issues are actively breaking production functionality and require immediate attention.

**Estimated Time to Fix Critical Issues:** 1-2 hours
**Estimated Time for Full Alignment:** 16-24 hours
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Production features are broken
