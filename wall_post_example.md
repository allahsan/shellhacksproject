Hey everyone!

We just launched TeamsDock and honestly I'm kind of blown away that it's actually working. Like, people are actually using it to find teams right now. Wild.

For those who just got here - this is basically our attempt to solve the whole "I need a team but Discord is chaos and nobody replies" problem. We built it today because we were tired of seeing people struggle to find teammates every single hackathon.

The idea is simple. You post what you're good at, what you want to build, and actually see who's online right now. No more messaging into the void hoping someone responds. We've all been there.

I'm watching people form teams in real-time through this and it's pretty surreal. Already saw a few groups go from complete strangers to planning out their entire project architecture. That's exactly what we hoped would happen.

If you're reading this, you're literally among the first people to ever use TeamsDock. So yeah, if something breaks or looks weird, let us know. We're fixing bugs as we go. Already patched like three things in the last hour after someone tried to put emojis in their phone number field (you know who you are).

But seriously, start posting! Share what you're working on, what kind of teammates you need, or just vent about your code not working. This wall is here for all of it. The more active we make this, the better it gets for everyone trying to connect.

Also if you find a bug, please don't hack us. We're running on three hours of sleep and pure determination here. Just tell us and we'll fix it.

What's everyone building? Anyone need a teammate? Let's get this wall going. First few posts on a new platform are always awkward but someone's gotta start.

PS - Yes we know the phone number thing was broken earlier. It should work now. Hopefully.
