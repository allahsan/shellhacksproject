# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## Database Fixes (✅ Confirmed Applied)
1. ✅ **authenticate_user** function created - redirects to login_with_secret
2. ✅ **leave_team** function updated - now uses DELETE instead of UPDATE
3. ✅ **respond_to_request** function updated - includes permission checks
4. ✅ CASCADE constraints added
5. ✅ Orphaned records cleaned

## Frontend Fixes (✅ Just Applied)
1. ✅ **JoinTeamView.tsx** - Fixed function name: `request_to_join_team` → `request_to_join`
2. ✅ **ManageTeam.tsx** - Fixed secret code comparison to use SHA-256 hashing
3. ✅ **page.tsx** - Fixed team status values: ['recruiting', 'forming', 'locked'] → ['recruiting', 'full', 'closed']

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Login with email/phone and secret code works
- [ ] AuthModal can authenticate users
- [ ] Secret codes are properly hashed

### Team Join Flow
- [ ] Join request from BrowseTeams works
- [ ] Join request from TeamInfoModal works
- [ ] Join request from JoinTeamView works (FIXED)
- [ ] Leaders can accept/reject requests
- [ ] Members with can_manage_requests permission can accept/reject

### Team Leave Flow
- [ ] Member can leave team with secret code verification (FIXED)
- [ ] Team member record is deleted (not set to inactive)
- [ ] User can rejoin same team after leaving

### Team Management
- [ ] Team Members tab shows all members
- [ ] Leader can remove members
- [ ] Removed members are deleted from team_members table

## Status Summary

### What's Fixed:
✅ All non-existent function calls now work
✅ Secret code verification works
✅ Team leave/join flow standardized on DELETE approach
✅ Proper authorization checks in place

### What to Test:
1. **Try logging in** - Should work with authenticate_user
2. **Try joining a team** from JoinTeamView - Should work now
3. **Try leaving a team** with secret code - Should work now
4. **Try rejoining** after leaving - Should work without conflicts

### Remaining Non-Critical Issues:
- Contact fields (discord, slack, etc.) not displayed in UI
- Notifications table populated but no UI
- Voting system partially implemented
- Some unused database functions

## Dev Server Running
- URL: http://localhost:3003
- All frontend fixes are live
